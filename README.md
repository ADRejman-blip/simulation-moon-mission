# Moon Mission Simulation 🚀

A simple, text-based moon mission simulation written in C++. 

## About this Project
This is my very first private C++ project. I built this to practice the fundamentals of C++ like classes, loops, object-oriented programming, and basic logic.

## Current Features
* Base structure with 2 classes (Rocket and Astronaut)


## Note on Language
Since this is my very first learning project, the source code, variables, and comments are currently written in German. As I progress in my studies, future projects (and also this one) will transition to English.

## How to Run
Compile the `.cpp` files using any standard C++ compiler (like `g++`) and run the executable in your terminal.
